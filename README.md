# u-nectix

A WIP algorithmic trading bot written in Python that leverages traditional technical indicators, Twitter data, the EDGAR database of SEC filings, and a simple regression algorithm implemented with Tensorflow.

The name comes from a combination of the word "equity" and the animal genus [eunectes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunectes), because naming Python applications after snakes is fun. Given that this trading bot runs on the [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) exchange, a South American snake populating roughly the same geograhical vicinity as the alpaca made sense.
